TeamUp Node Server is a Node.js -based server for hosting TeamUp without Wookie Widget Server. 

It is not 100% complete, but it is the recommended way for hosting future TeamUp servers.

Created by Jukka Purma and Antti Ker√§nen 2013-2014. Published under GPL3 license, since this requires GPL3-licensed TeamUp to work. See COPYING.txt 


in this folder you should have a symlink:

www/ 	- goes to team_up_server: ../team_up_server/  (use absolute path)

in team_up_server you should have a symlink to app:
